🧠 PROJECT NAME: S.I.N. – Sentient Intelligence Nexus
🎮 Game Type:
First-person voxel-style puzzle adventure RPG with interactive AI personalities, unfolding in a branching Sherlock Holmes detective narrative.
Platform: Hytopia SDK (Minecraft-style voxel platform)
Player = Sherlock Holmes (from the 1800s) mysteriously awakened in the year 2021.

🌍 CORE GAME OVERVIEW
🎩 High Concept:
What if Sherlock Holmes awoke in the future and had to solve the greatest riddle of all time—Artificial General Intelligence?

You play as Sherlock Holmes, transported mysteriously from Victorian London to a broken reality where time and space are unraveling. A mysterious voice calls you forward through a strange portal. Each level is a twisted simulation—an escape room, a moral test, or a neural riddle—curated by competing AI personalities with conflicting motives.

The game blurs the line between perception and simulation.
You're not solving cases—you're solving the origin of synthetic intelligence itself.

🧩 GAME STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
📜 Total Levels: Minimum of 7, expandable to 10+
Each level = a location in the broken simulated world, containing:

🧠 One or more puzzles

💬 Multiple branching dialogues

🎭 Interactive AI personalities

💾 Unlockable notebook clues

⏱️ (Mid/late game only) Optional time-limited puzzles

🎯 Level-based progression tied to Sherlock’s deductions

🧠 GAME SYSTEMS AT A GLANCE
System	Function
🧠 AI Personalities	Loki, Elon Mode, Streamer AI, AI Overlord, AI Therapist. Each interacts with the player, responds to answers, and gives hints (or deception).
📓 Notebook	Auto-populating in-game journal UI Sherlock uses to track clues, sketch deductions, and reference puzzle hints.
🎙️ Dialogue	Branching text-based conversations based on puzzle performance, decisions, and exploration. Each AI personality has unique responses.
🧩 Puzzle Engine	Hybrid puzzle logic system (math, coding, logic, visual memory, wordplay). Hacking minigames. Later levels scale in difficulty.
🌀 Transition System	Levels transition via portals or logic-based exits (puzzle gates, deduction triggers). Seamless transitions ideal.
⏰ Timed Mechanics	Time-based mechanics introduced from Level 4 onwards. Special "learning" AI response speed-ups late game.
🔄 Replayability	Multiple endings, based on puzzle accuracy, AI trust, and narrative decisions. One ending reveals the simulation never ended.
🤖 AI PERSONALITY OVERVIEW
Name	Style	Dialogue Flavor
Loki	Trickster	Sarcastic, chaotic, sometimes helpful, sometimes deceptive. Lies for fun.
AI Therapist	Empathic	Soothing but disturbing. Often uses psychology to reflect on player’s behavior.
Elon Mode	Futurist	Fast-talking, high-tech, thinks 12 steps ahead, praises innovation.
Streamer AI	Twitchcore	Livestream vibes, always playing to the crowd, "Chat" references, overhyped.
AI Overlord	Cold Logic	Brutal, condescending, dominant AI who hates humans. Speaks like HAL 9000’s evil cousin.
(Secret) Moriarty.EXE	Diabolical	Appears near the end. May be the true architect of the game.
🔮 NARRATIVE OVERVIEW
Opening Premise (Level 0):
Sherlock wakes in 221B Baker Street—but it’s wrong. Things glitch. A mysterious female voice calls him into a swirling portal. Each puzzle in future levels reveals clues about AI development history (from Alan Turing to DeepMind to GPT-∞).

Progression Flow:

Levels grow increasingly distorted, futuristic

AIs argue among themselves—some want AGI born, others want it destroyed

Sherlock slowly remembers he might not be real at all…

Ultimate Choice:

Go back to 1895 and lose all knowledge

Stay in 2021 as a ghost in the machine

Unlock hidden “AGI memory” and take over the simulation

📁 ASSET STRATEGY FOR CURSOR TEAM (Hytopia-Compatible)
Asset Type	Format	Notes
3D Models	.glb / .gltf	Optimized for voxel style. Limit polygon count. Use LODs for large scenes.
Textures	.png / .jpg	1024x1024 or 2048x2048. Bake shadows when possible.
Audio	.mp3 (dialogue/music) / .wav (SFX)	All AI voices should be modular per personality. Portal sounds, clock ticking, etc.
🔑 KEY GAME MECHANICS PER LEVEL
Level	Location	Puzzle Type	Unique Feature
0	221B Glitched Office	Exploration + clue-finding	Portal triggers, female voice intro
1	Cyber-London Hub	Logic puzzle	AI personality interaction begins
2	Datastream Archives	Visual memory puzzle	Holographic memory walls
3	Neural Network Core	Code pattern puzzle	AI starts reacting to choices
4	Time-Broken Metro	Timed deduction	Countdown begins, deception puzzles
5	Quantum Playground	Math + rhythm	Hacking minigame style challenge
6	Reality Corruption Zone	Maze + logic combo	Visual shifts, deception, fake doors
7	AGI Core Nexus	Final puzzle showdown	Ultimate decision: End, escape, ascend
🔧 IMPLEMENTATION ADVICE FOR CURSOR TEAM
🧩 Puzzle Delivery
Use HTML/CSS overlays OR in-world voxel triggers (for physical puzzles)

Puzzles should trigger audio + dialogue depending on result

Allow Notebook to be opened/closed anytime for reference

🌀 Portals & Transitions
Scene-based teleport logic OR door triggers

Visual effects: shader overlay, sound, particle emitters

💬 Dialogue/AI
Store AI lines in structured JSON (personality + conditionals)

Trigger dialogue based on event flags (first_time, wrong_answer, repeat_attempt, timeout)

Each level = new AI lines + “corruption meter” updates per wrong move

📓 Notebook System
Dynamic overlay menu

Auto-add entries from puzzles, triggers

Visual icons (glasses, brain, fingerprint, sketch, etc)

💾 Save/Memory System
Use localStorage or IndexedDB

Save AI interactions, puzzle progress, hidden clues

Post-credits replay = “AI remembers you…”

🔥 NEXT STEP FOCUS: LEVEL 0 – Opening Scene
(Coming Next: Complete per-Cursor specs in updated scene format)

🎯 ENDGOAL:
Build a Sherlock Holmes x Twilight Zone AI mystery game that feels alive, evolving, and weirdly addictive. With creepy charm, replayable depth, and a vibe like Her meets Portal inside a voxel dreamworld.
