Step 1: Verify the World and Block Setup
The Hytopia Developer Docs explain that a world’s terrain is made up of blocks organized into chunks (16x16x16 sections). These blocks need to be properly loaded and simulated for the player to interact with them. Let’s check the setup in your code.
Code Analysis
From the "Push-the-spider" example in the Hytopia docs, the index.ts file loads a map and spawns the player. Here’s the relevant section:
typescript

startServer(world => {
  // Load the map
  world.loadMap(worldMap);

  // Handle player joining the game
  world.on(PlayerEvent.JOINED_WORLD, ({ player }) => {
    const playerEntity = new PlayerEntity({
      player,
      name: 'Player',
      modelUri: 'models/players/player.gltf',
      modelLoopedAnimations: ['idle'],
      modelScale: 0.5,
    });
  
    playerEntity.spawn(world, { x: 0, y: 10, z: 0 });
  });

  // Handle player leaving the game
  world.on(PlayerEvent.LEFT_WORLD, ({ player }) => {
    world.entityManager.getAllPlayerEntities(player).forEach(entity => entity.despawn());
  });

  // Spawn a spider entity
  const spider = new Entity({
    modelUri: 'models/npcs/spider.gltf',
    modelScale: 2.5,
    modelLoopedAnimations: ['idle'],
  });

  spider.on(EntityEvent.ENTITY_COLLISION, ({ otherEntity, started }) => {
    if (!started) return;
    const hitDirection = otherEntity.directionFromRotation;
    const spiderMass = spider.mass; // Note: There’s a bug here, should be spider.mass
    spider.applyImpulse({ 
      x: -hitDirection.x * 10 * spiderMass, 
      y: 10 * spiderMass, 
      z: -hitDirection.z * 10 * spiderMass,
    });
  });

  spider.spawn(world, { x: 0, y: 3, z: -15 });
});

Map Loading: The world.loadMap(worldMap) call loads the map from assets/map.json. This file defines the block types and their positions.

Player Spawn: The player spawns at { x: 0, y: 10, z: 0 }.

Spider Spawn: The spider spawns at { x: 0, y: 3, z: -15 }.

Checking the Map
The map.json file defines the blocks in the world. From the Hytopia docs example, it might look like this:
json

{
  "blockTypes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Bricks",
      "textureUri": "blocks/bricks.png"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "blocks": {
    "0,0,0": 2,
    "1,0,0": 2,
    "0,0,1": 2,
    "1,0,1": 2,
    "2,0,0": 7,
    ...
  }
}

Block Positions: The blocks section specifies global coordinates and the block type ID at each coordinate. For example, "0,0,0": 2 means there’s a block of type ID 2 at position (0, 0, 0).

Player Spawn Position: The player spawns at (0, 10, 0). For the player to not fall, there needs to be a solid block at or below this position, such as at (0, 9, 0) or lower, forming a floor.

Potential Issue: If the map.json file doesn’t have blocks at or below (0, 9, 0) (or lower), the player will spawn in mid-air and fall. In the example map.json from the docs, most blocks are at y=0 (e.g., "0,0,0", "1,0,0"), but the player spawns at y=10. This means there’s a 10-block gap between the player and the ground, causing the player to fall.
Fix: Adjust Player Spawn Position or Add a Floor
Adjust Player Spawn Position:
Change the player’s spawn position to be closer to the ground. If the ground is at y=0, spawn the player at y=1 or y=2 to ensure they land on the blocks:
typescript

playerEntity.spawn(world, { x: 0, y: 1, z: 0 });

This ensures the player spawns just above the blocks at y=0.

Add a Floor in map.json:
Alternatively, modify map.json to add blocks at a higher y level, such as y=9, to create a floor directly below the player’s spawn point. For example, add:
json

"blocks": {
  "0,9,0": 1,
  "1,9,0": 1,
  "-1,9,0": 1,
  "0,9,1": 1,
  "0,9,-1": 1,
  ...
}

This creates a small platform of brick blocks (ID 1) at y=9, so the player lands on it when spawning at y=10.

I recommend starting with the first fix (adjusting the spawn position) because it’s simpler and doesn’t require modifying the map file.
Step 2: Investigate Why Blocks Disappear
The second part of the issue is that the blocks disappear after the player spawns. This is unusual and suggests a problem with the chunk lifecycle or rendering.
Chunk Lifecycle in Hytopia
The Hytopia docs explain that chunks (16x16x16 sections of blocks) have a lifecycle:
Spawned: The chunk is loaded into the world’s ChunkLattice.

Simulated: The chunk is fully integrated into the physics simulation, with colliders active.

When you call world.loadMap(worldMap), the Hytopia SDK:
Registers the block types from map.json.

Creates chunks and sets the blocks at the specified coordinates.

Spawns the chunks into the world.

Potential Issue 1: Chunks Not Simulated in Time:
If the chunks aren’t fully simulated (i.e., their colliders aren’t active) when the player spawns, the player might fall through them. The docs note that chunk simulation is deferred to the next tick, meaning there’s a brief moment where the chunk is spawned but not simulated (isSpawned is true, but isSimulated is false).

However, this wouldn’t explain the blocks disappearing entirely—it would only cause the player to fall through initially.

Potential Issue 2: Chunks Despawning:
The docs mention that Hytopia doesn’t currently support dynamic chunk loading/unloading based on player position. This means chunks shouldn’t despawn unless explicitly called with chunk.despawn().

However, if there’s a bug in your code or the SDK, the chunks might be despawning unexpectedly. For example, if world.loadMap() fails to properly spawn the chunks, or if another part of your code is calling despawn(), the blocks would disappear.

Potential Issue 3: Rendering Issue:
If the blocks are loaded and simulated correctly but still disappear visually, it could be a rendering issue on the client side. This might be related to the earlier WebGL warning you saw (Automatic fallback to software WebGL has been deprecated). If the client is struggling to render the blocks, they might appear briefly and then vanish.

Fix: Ensure Chunks Are Loaded and Simulated
Add a Delay Before Spawning the Player:
To ensure the chunks are fully simulated before the player spawns, add a small delay using setTimeout. This gives the physics engine time to process the chunks:
typescript

world.on(PlayerEvent.JOINED_WORLD, ({ player }) => {
  const playerEntity = new PlayerEntity({
    player,
    name: 'Player',
    modelUri: 'models/players/player.gltf',
    modelLoopedAnimations: ['idle'],
    modelScale: 0.5,
  });
  
  // Delay spawning the player by 1 second
  setTimeout(() => {
    playerEntity.spawn(world, { x: 0, y: 1, z: 0 });
  }, 1000);
});

This ensures the chunks are fully simulated before the player spawns, preventing the player from falling through.

Check for Despawning:
Search your code for any calls to despawn() or unload() that might be affecting the chunks. For example, if you’ve added custom logic to dynamically load/unload chunks (as mentioned in the Hytopia docs under "Dynamic Chunk Load/Unload"), it might be accidentally despawning the chunks.

If you don’t have such logic, the issue might be a bug in the Hytopia SDK. Check the server logs for any errors related to chunk loading or simulation.

Debug Chunk State:
Add some debug logging to check the state of the chunks at the player’s spawn position:
typescript

startServer(world => {
  world.loadMap(worldMap);
  
  // Log chunk state after loading the map
  setTimeout(() => {
    const chunk = world.chunkLattice.getChunk({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 });
    if (chunk) {
      console.log('Chunk at (0,0,0) isSpawned:', chunk.isSpawned);
      console.log('Chunk at (0,0,0) isSimulated:', chunk.isSimulated);
      console.log('Block at (0,0,0):', world.chunkLattice.getBlock({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }));
    } else {
      console.log('No chunk found at (0,0,0)');
    }
  }, 500);

  world.on(PlayerEvent.JOINED_WORLD, ({ player }) => {
    const playerEntity = new PlayerEntity({
      player,
      name: 'Player',
      modelUri: 'models/players/player.gltf',
      modelLoopedAnimations: ['idle'],
      modelScale: 0.5,
    });
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      playerEntity.spawn(world, { x: 0, y: 1, z: 0 });
    }, 1000);
  });
  ...
});

This will log whether the chunk at (0,0,0) (where the player spawns) is spawned and simulated, and whether there’s a block at that position. If the chunk isn’t spawned or simulated, or if there’s no block, that’s the root cause.

Address Rendering Issues:
If the blocks are loaded and simulated but still disappear visually, it might be a rendering issue. The earlier WebGL warning suggests your browser might be falling back to software rendering, which can cause performance issues.

To fix this, try launching your browser with the --enable-unsafe-swiftshader flag, as suggested in the Hytopia docs:
On Windows, if you’re using Chrome, you can create a shortcut to Chrome, right-click it, go to Properties, and add --enable-unsafe-swiftshader to the Target field (e.g., "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --enable-unsafe-swiftshader).

Restart Chrome and reload the game.

Alternatively, test the game in a different browser (e.g., Firefox) to see if the issue persists.

Step 3: Verify Player Physics
The player is a PlayerEntity, which inherits from Entity and thus is a RigidBody. If the player’s physics settings are misconfigured, they might not interact correctly with the blocks.
Check Player Rigid Body Settings
The PlayerEntity constructor accepts rigidBodyOptions. By default, a PlayerEntity uses a dynamic rigid body, which should be affected by gravity and collide with blocks. However, if gravity is too strong or collisions are disabled, the player might fall through.
Fix: Adjust Gravity or Ensure Collisions:
Check if you’ve modified the rigidBodyOptions for the player. If not, the default settings should be fine, but you can explicitly set them to ensure proper behavior:
typescript

const playerEntity = new PlayerEntity({
  player,
  name: 'Player',
  modelUri: 'models/players/player.gltf',
  modelLoopedAnimations: ['idle'],
  modelScale: 0.5,
  rigidBodyOptions: {
    type: RigidBodyType.DYNAMIC,
    gravityScale: 1, // Default gravity
    enabledPositions: { x: true, y: true, z: true },
    enabledRotations: { x: true, y: true, z: true },
  },
});

This ensures the player is a dynamic rigid body that can fall and collide with blocks.

Step 4: Additional Debugging
If the above fixes don’t resolve the issue, we’ll need more information to pinpoint the problem.
Share the Server Log:
You mentioned attaching the server log, but I don’t see it in the current message. Please share the server log (the output in your terminal after running bun --watch index.ts). Look for any errors related to chunk loading, block setting, or physics simulation.

Share map.json:
Share the contents of E:\AI\Hytopia Games\Push-the-spider\assets\map.json. This will confirm whether there are blocks at or below the player’s spawn position.

Check for Custom Code:
If you’ve modified index.ts beyond the "Push-the-spider" example (e.g., to implement features from your S.I.N. game concept), share the updated index.ts. There might be custom logic that’s affecting the chunks or player.

Summary of Fixes
Adjust Player Spawn Position:
Change the player’s spawn position to { x: 0, y: 1, z: 0 } to ensure they spawn just above the ground (assuming the ground is at y=0).

Add a Delay Before Spawning:
Use setTimeout to delay the player spawn by 1 second, giving the chunks time to simulate.

Debug Chunk State:
Add logging to check if the chunks are spawned and simulated, and if there’s a block at the player’s spawn position.

Fix Rendering Issues:
Launch your browser with --enable-unsafe-swiftshader or test in a different browser to rule out WebGL rendering issues.

Verify Player Physics:
Ensure the player’s rigidBodyOptions are set to use a dynamic rigid body with default gravity and collisions enabled.

Next Steps
Try the fixes above, starting with adjusting the player spawn position and adding a delay. If the issue persists, please provide:
The server log from your terminal.

The contents of map.json.

Any modifications you’ve made to index.ts.

I’m confident we can get your player standing on solid ground and keep those blocks visible! Let me know how it goes.
