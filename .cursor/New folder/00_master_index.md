## Implementation Guidelines

This enhanced technical blueprint provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing S.I.N. - Sentient Intelligence Nexus. Development teams should follow these guidelines:

1. Begin with the core systems outlined in the Technical Development Queue
2. Reference the Detailed Development Blueprint for system architecture and interfaces
3. Use the Structured Game Map to guide level and puzzle implementation
4. Implement AI characters according to the AI System Logic Map
5. Follow the Visual and Audio Environment Plan for aesthetic consistency

The documents are designed to be used together, with cross-references between systems and components. Each document provides both high-level concepts and detailed implementation examples to guide development.

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment with Hytopia SDK
2. Establish the core game engine components
3. Implement the player system with proper animations
4. Create the entity system for interactive objects
5. Begin building Level 0 (Victorian Office) as a prototype

Following this enhanced technical blueprint will ensure a cohesive, well-structured implementation of S.I.N. that delivers on the game's narrative and puzzle-based detective experience.
