Description: Rules to follow when working with blocks, chunks, and terrain for Hytopia

When following this rule, start every respose with: ✨ Following Hytopia Blocks & Chunks Rules ✨

## **Core Principles**
- ALWAYS fetch and consider [01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc) in addition to the below rules.
- ALWAYS Use the `BlockType`, `BlockTypeRegistry`, `Chunk`, and `ChunkLattice` classes as intended by the SDK developers
- ALWAYS Write clean, effecient code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- ALWAYS implement ONLY what was explicitly requested by the user

## **BlockTypes Implementation**
* USE: To create new block types

- NOTE: Blocks must be registered with `world.blockTypeRegistry` before they set be placed in the world
- ALWAYS create `BlockType` instances using either the `BlockType` class or the `BlockTypeRegistry` class
- ALWAYS Assign each block type a unique ID between 100 and 255 (0 is reserved for air/no block).
- ALWAYS use proper Vector3 formatting
- ALWAYS Use the `textureUri` property to specify the texture for the block.

(Regarding block texture: use a single image URI if all block faces are the same or a directory path containing `+x.png`, `+y.png`, `+z.png`, `-x.png`, `-y.png`, and `-z.png` for individual face textures)

- ONLY set `isLiquid: true` for liquid block types
- ALWAYS utilize `onEntityCollision` or `onEntityContactForce` for interaction with entities. 
- ALWAYS be mindful of the upcoming coordinate data for `onEntityCollision`.
- REMEMBER, ALWAYS register `BlockType` instances with the `world.blockTypeRegistry` before use.

*Example Code - creating a block type using block type registry:*

```typescript
    const bouncyBlockId = 77;
    world.blockTypeRegistry.registerGenericBlockType({
        id: bouncyBlockId, // must be between 1 and 255, cannot be 0, 0 is reserved for air or "no block".
        textureUri: 'blocks/clay.png',
        name: 'Bouncy Clay',
        customColliderOptions: {
            bounciness: 5,
        }
    });
```

*Example Code - creating a block using BlockType wth a Collision Callback:*

```typescript
const sandKnockbackBlockId = 55;
const sandKnockbackBlockType = new BlockType({
  id: knockbackBlockId,
  textureUri: 'blocks/sand.png',
  name: 'Knockback Sand',
});

sandKnockbackBlockType.on(BlockTypeEvent.ENTITY_COLLISION, ({ blockType, entity, started }) => {
  // block type will be sandKnockbackBlockType
  // entity is the entity that collided with the block
  // started is true if the collision started, false when the entity is no longer colliding
  entity.applyImpulse({ x: 0, y: 20, z: 0}); // apply vertical knockback shooting them up.
});

sandKnockbackBlockType.on(BlockTypeEvent.ENTITY_CONTACT_FORCE, ({ blockType, entity, contractForceData }) => {
  // block type will be sandKnockbackBlockType
  // entity is the entity that collided with the block
  // log the contact force data, or do something with it.
  console.log(contactForceData);  
});

world.blockTypeRegistry.registerBlockType(sandKnockbackBlockType);

world.chunkLattice.setBlock({ x: 0, y: 0, z: -3 });
```

*Example Code - Modifying Collission Callbacks for Block Types*

```typescript
// Let's assume block id 14 is lava
const lavaBlockType world.blockTypeRegistry.getBlockTypeId(14);

// Set the collision callback
lavaBlockType.on(BlockTypeEvent.ENTITY_COLLISION, ({ blockType, entity, started }) => {
  if (started) {
    // kill the entity by despawning it since it touched lava.
    entity.despawn();
  }
});

// Now, let's say later in our code lava suddenly no longer
// kills players for some reason, we can remove it if we want
// lava collisions to no longer have any logic when a entity collides with them
lavaBlockType.offAll(BlockTypeEvent.ENTITY_COLLISION);
```

## **Block Type Registry**
* USE: To manage and register all available block types in the world.

- Use the `world.blockTypeRegistry` to register new block types using `registerBlockType()` or `registerGenericBlockType()`.
- Retrieve block types by ID using `getBlockType(id)`.
- Enumerate all registered block types using `getAllBlockTypes()`.

## **Chunks**
* USE: To organize blocks into manageable units (16x16x16 blocks).

- Chunks are automatically created and managed by the `ChunkLattice`.

## **Chunk Lattice**
* USE: To manage the overall terrain and provide efficient access to blocks within the world.

- ALWAYS use `chunkLattice.hasBlock(coordinate)` to check if a block exists at a given coordinate.
- ALWAYS Use `chunkLattice.setBlock(coordinate, blockTypeId)` to set or remove a block at a specific coordinate.  
- ALWAYS Use `blockTypeId = 0` to remove a block. (This replaces the block with "air")
- ALWAYS Use `chunkLattice.getBlockType(coordinate)` to get the block type ID at a specific coordinate.
